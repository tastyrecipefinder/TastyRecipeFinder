### App Evaluation

- **Mobile:** This app will be primarily developed to function on a mobile phone but could be modified to be compatible with a computer system in the future.
- **Story:** This app allows usesrs to post recipes and discover other people's recipes based on what they search for. Users would be able to follow others to allow for people to keep up to date on their favorite chefs.
- **Market:** This app would be available to any invidual who enjoys cooking and trying new recipes. 
- **Habit:** This app allows for people to use it whenever they would like to. It would be useful everyday for someone who likes to experiment in the kitchen and/or share their own recipes.
